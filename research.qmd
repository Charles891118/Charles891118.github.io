<div id="pub2" class="research-abstract">
Taiwan's social assistance system emphasizes work ethics and self-reliance. A key feature is the "putative income" regulation, which imputes earnings to non-working applicants. This policy has been controversial, as many genuinely struggling households are deemed ineligible for assistance. While past research has used interviews to critique the system's fairness, this study employs model family data and government administrative records to simulate the effects of abolishing the regulation on benefit generosity, poverty reduction, and coverage. Results show that removing putative income would significantly increase the income of zero-earning households, helping them meet basic needs. However, it would not substantially expand social assistance coverage. International comparisons indicate that abolishing the regulation would not transform Taiwan into a generous welfare state. Reforming the current benefit calculation to better reflect the needs of low-wage earners could enhance fairness and adequacy in supporting families in economic distress.

**Background**: This study combines a nationally representative sample from Taiwan with four years of National Health Insurance (NHI) data to explore the distinctive impact of emotional and social loneliness on health service utilization, including outpatient visits for mental health, general outpatient visits, emergency room (ER) visits, and hospitalization.

**Methods**: Data were drawn from the 2015 Taiwan Longitudinal Survey on Aging (TLSA) and merged with participants’ NHI records from 2015 to 2018. The analysis used logistic regression for binary outcomes and negative binomial regression for counts.

**Results**: Results show that higher emotional loneliness in 2015 was associated with increased outpatient mental health visits over time and more general outpatient visits within the same year. Conversely, higher social loneliness in 2015 reduced the likelihood of seeking ER care in 2015.

**Conclusions**: By merging national data and distinguishing emotional from social loneliness, this study offers insights into their differential impacts on healthcare utilization among older adults in Taiwan. It emphasizes the importance of addressing loneliness to improve physical and mental well-being and optimize the effective utilization of healthcare resources.

This project examines how changes in eligibility criteria for low-income assistance programs shape access to benefits and subsequent outcomes among older adults. Focusing on subsidy take-up behavior, the study identifies the causal effects of eligibility expansions on employment, fertility, domestic violence, and broader measures of well-being using quasi-experimental methods and administrative data.
