Welcome to my personal website!

I am a second-year master's student in Economics at National Taiwan University, where I also earned dual bachelor's degrees in Economics and Social Work. 

My research interests focus on social policy, aging, and health, with an emphasis on quantitative analysis using administrative and longitudinal data.
